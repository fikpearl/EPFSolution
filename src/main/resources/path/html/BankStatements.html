<!--Here we have code that  is a HTML page with CSS and JavaScript.

The code is for a website that has two different types of boxes: the main content area, which is in the center of the screen, and an advertisement box on the right side of the screen.
The first thing to notice about this code is that it uses "box-sizing" to make sure that all elements are displayed as squares instead of rectangles.
This makes it easier to see how much space each element takes up on your computer screen.
Next, there are some styles for body text: font family (Pangolin), color (dimgray), width (90%), padding (1em) and display style (inline-block).
There's also a table wrapper class with 30px padding around its border radius, lightblue background color, and 10px border radius.
Finally there's a label class with 0.5em margin around its block display style so you can see where they start and end on your computer screen when you hover over them
